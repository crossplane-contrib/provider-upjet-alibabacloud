                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                  See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223
